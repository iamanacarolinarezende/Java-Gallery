- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another relational database management system
- **Framework**: JavaFX for the graphical user interface
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, GitPod
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub)

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different packages to separate related functionalities such as artwork registration, artist registration, inventory management, sales logging, and report generation. Each package contains Java classes responsible for implementing the respective functionalities.

## Workflow
1. The user accesses the system and is presented with an intuitive graphical interface.
2. They can navigate through the different functionalities of the system, such as artwork registration, artist, Curator and ArtPiece registration, inventory management, sales logging, and report generation.
3. For each functionality, the user can interact with input fields, buttons, and menus to perform the desired operations.
4. The information entered or modified by the user is stored in the database for later retrieval and manipulation.
5. The system allows generating detailed reports on sales made, current inventory, registered artists, among other aspects.
